- material properties and description (https://craftcloud3d.com/material-guide/sls-nylon-pa12)
  - Nylon PA12 (Polyamide) is a fantastic all-round material with high precision that is also good value for money. When thin, it is flexible enough for springs – when thick, it is strong enough for functional parts. Thanks to that strength and flexibility, it is extremely versatile and suitable for many varied applications. It comes in a variety of colors, and its surface can be polished and dyed. This material is 3D printed on industrial grade 3D printers for the highest quality, using a process called Selective Laser Sintering. PA12 absorbs less water than PA6, but PA6 is stronger than PA12.
